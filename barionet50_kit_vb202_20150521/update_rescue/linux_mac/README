Preparation for Linux on x86
============================
This is for a PC with 386, 486, Pentium, Athlon 32 and similar processors, with
Linux (Redhat, SuSE, Debian, Ubuntu, Mandrake, Slackware, Knoppix, Gentoo, LFS,
GNU/Linux etc.). You don't need to do any preparation because we supply a
statically linked binary.

Preparation for other POSIX operating systems than Linux on x86
===============================================================
This is for Linux/Unix on Intel 64, AMD 64, Apple (MAC OS X), Sun Solaris, SGI
Irix, commercial UNIX, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD. Your system must be POSIX
compliant, otherwise the compilation may fail.

You need a C compiler and a Make program installed. Remove the file "load" (rm
load) and type "make". This will rebuild the program "load" again for your
specific conditions. Then continue with "Linux on x86" (see above).

Starting the program
====================
Select the "seriald" command to load the software. This command requires a
parameter to define the PC serial port used which can be chosen as follows:

Serial port  		Use 
-----------             -----------
COM1                    ./serial1.sh (this file contains ./seriald.sh /dev/ttyS0)
COM2                    ./seriald.sh /dev/ttyS1
other serial ports      ./seriald.sh /dev/...
