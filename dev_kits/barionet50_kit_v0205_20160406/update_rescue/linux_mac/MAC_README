Serial Rescue Procedure on Apple Mac OS X
=========================================

For the "Serial Rescue" on an Apple computer running Mac OS X you will need:
- a standard USB to RS-232 serial port converter with an appropriate
  Mac OS X driver installed
- the application "Terminal" (installed with Mac OS X)
- a null modem cable

As the Mac OS X does not use standard names (ttyS0 to ttyS3) we need to first
discover the device name of the installed serial converter.

1.	Open the application "Terminal" (in the Finder double click the icon
	Terminal.app" located in the subfolder "Utilities" in the folder
	"Applications") and type in ls /dev/tty.*  and hit the Enter key:

	The list will show all available serial interfaces.
	Note the one stating USB, Serial or the product name of your USB converter
	If you are not sure which one it is disconnect the converter and repeat the
	above step to spot the difference.

2.	Make sure you are in the "linux_mac" folder within the Update Kit
	"update_rescue" folder. Use the command "pwd" to show the current directory
	and the "cd" command to navigate. For example from the outer folder of the
	kit: cd update_rescue/linux_mac

3.  Unplug power supply.

4.  Connect the null modem cable between your USB to RS-232 serial port
	converter and the device's serial port.

5.	In the terminal, type the following:
	./seriald.sh /dev/tty.usbserial
	where "usbserial" is replaced with the name discovered in step 1. 
	Hit the Enter key.

6.	A message 'Waiting for the device' will be shown on the bottom of the screen.

7.	Plug in the power supply now. You will see the following:
	Several parts are sent in a sequence. 
	The progress is shown in kilo bytes (KiB) sent. 
	Once all is sent the device will reboot automatically.

8.	Wait until a message 'SUCCESSFUL' appears on the second last line.

9.	Close the Terminal application.
	Your device is set to factory defaults and should now work.
